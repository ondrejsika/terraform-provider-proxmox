This provider is a fork of [Telmate/proxmox](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Telmate/proxmox), with some needed changes to make it available on Terraform Registry. Temporarily this was put on registry as well.

Please use [Telmate/proxmox](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Telmate/proxmox) instead.

a list of the options for both the provider and the provisioner. Moreover, there are some guides available how to combine
options and start specific VMs.
